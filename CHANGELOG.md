## [0.9.0] - 2025-08-27

### Added

- Support `no-std` builds.
- `Router::get` and `Router::get_mut` methods to access data from pre-existing templates.

### Changed

- Raised MSRV from 1.63 to 1.85.
- Switch to Rust 2024 edition.
- Syntax for parameters has changed from `{name}` to `<name>`, to remove ambiguity with formatted strings.
- Parameter characters `<` and `>` can no longer be escaped, since they aren't valid URL characters anyways.
- Display no longer shows nodes storing data, since it was redundant.

### Removed

- Constraints are no longer supported.
- Optional groups are no longer supported.
- `Parameters` alias has been removed.

### Fixed

- Improved detection of structural conflicts.
- Corrected routing priority for inline parameters.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-01-07

### Fixed

- Remove required lifetime from router.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-01-07

### Changed

- The router no longer performs percent-decoding.
- Searches no longer error on any invalid UTF-8 parameters, instead acting as if the path doesn't match instead.
- Error messages are now more consistent.
- The term 'route' has been replaced with 'template'.
- Lowered MSRV from 1.66 to 1.63.

### Removed

- The `Routable` wrapper is no longer needed. The router uses strings for inserts.
- The `Path` wrapper is no longer needed. The router uses strings for searches.
- `EncodingError` has been removed.
- `PathError` has been removed.
- `RoutableError` has been removed.

### Fixed

- Priority logic now correctly prefers depth, then length, of templates.

## [0.7.0] - 2024-11-12

### Added

- Support builder pattern for constructing routables.

### Changed

- `Router` now requires an explicit lifetime.
- All routes now require a leading `/`.
- Router display no longer shows internal root node. Matchable nodes are now denoted by `[*]`.
- Route expander now converts empty routes `""` to `"/"`.
- `Parameters` lists make use of `smallvec` now.

### Removed

- Individual parameters are returned as tuples, rather than `Parameter`.

### Fixed

- Touching parameters are now correctly rejected.

## [0.6.0] - 2024-10-27

### Added

- Added support for optional groups in routes.
- Added support for inline wildcards.

### Changed

- Inserts and deletes should be much more efficient now.
- Syntax for escaping parameters has changed to use the `\` character.
- Route errors now have more consistent error messages.
- Duplicate route error now shows which route caused the conflict.
- Added priority ranking to routes.

### Removed

- Optional parameters have been replaced with optional groups.
- Optional trailing slashes have been replaced with optional groups.

## [0.5.0] - 2024-09-11

### Changed

- Successful matches now return a flattened representation of node data.
- Route encoding errors now live in the encoding error enum.
- Router display now uses different characters to represent root and matchable nodes.
